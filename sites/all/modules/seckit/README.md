# Description

Security Kit (SecKit) provides various options to improve the security
of Drupal web sites.

Modern browsers support many techniques for mitigating common web
vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking.  However, these techniques
require server-side implementation, so SecKit provides an easy and
flexible way to support these features.
